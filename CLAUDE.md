# For Claude (or any new contributor)

Start with these, in order:

1. **[README.md](./README.md)** — what this project is, how to build and run it, the tool
   inventory, configuration, and current status.
2. **[DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md)** — the architectural principles. Read this *before* adding a tool,
   or you'll be tempted to put logic here that belongs in the calling LLM or in
   `cedar-artifact-mcp`. This MCP is a thin, honest conduit to the CEDAR REST API.
3. **[ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md)** — what's in v1, what's deferred, what's out of scope.

After those three, the code is self-explanatory. Patterns to mirror:

- **CRUD tools are generated, not hand-written.** The four artifact kinds differ only by path
  segment and tool noun (`ArtifactType`), so `ArtifactCrudTools.all(http)` builds all 16
  `get/create/update/delete` tools; the server registers them in a loop. Add a kind by extending
  the enum, not by writing four classes. One-off tools (e.g. `validate_artifact`) are their own
  class returning an `ArtifactCrudTools.RegisteredTool`.
- **All network I/O goes through the `CedarHttp` seam.** Handlers never touch `HttpClient`
  directly — they call `http.request(...)`. This is what makes them unit-testable against a fake
  transport (see `CedarRestToolsTest`). Don't bypass it.
- **YAML in, JSON on the wire, compact YAML out.** Use `ArtifactCodec` for every conversion —
  never hand-roll JSON↔YAML. Inbound is keyed on the tool's `ArtifactType`.
- **`create` nulls the top-level `@id`; `update` preserves it.** See DESIGN.md Principle 4.
- **Errors are content** (DESIGN.md Principle 5): a non-2xx response is an `isError` result
  carrying the HTTP status and server body — never a thrown protocol error.
- **Mutating tools are flagged in their descriptions.** `delete_*` is destructive; its description
  tells the LLM to confirm with the user. The tool surface is the LLM's only documentation —
  be concrete about inputs, outputs, the `@id` behaviour, and the danger of writes.
- **Secrets never appear in code, logs, or output.** The API key comes from `CEDAR_API_KEY` and is
  only ever placed in the `Authorization` header (`CedarConfig`).

## Testing

- **Default build runs mocked tests only.** Unit tests drive the handlers through a fake
  `CedarHttp` (`CedarRestToolsTest`) — no key, no server. Every new tool gets one.
- **Live tests are opt-in.** `CedarLifecycleIT` is tagged `@Tag("live")` and excluded from the
  default build (failsafe `excludedGroups=live`); run it with `mvn verify -Plive` and
  `CEDAR_API_KEY` set. It hits a real server, so every test **must delete whatever it creates**
  (cleanup in a `finally`, asserted). This mirrors `bioportal-term-mcp`'s `live` pytest marker.

## Build conventions

- Java 17 source/target.
- `mvn package` produces an executable shaded jar at `target/cedar-artifact-rest-mcp-<version>-all.jar`.
- The shade plugin needs explicit filters to strip Jackson 2.x annotation classes bundled inside
  `cedar-model-library` / `cedar-model-validation-library` (they shadow the Jackson 3.x
  annotations the MCP SDK requires). See `pom.xml`; do not remove them.
- Comments describe code-level facts only — no references to PRs, sessions, or "this change".

## What's not in scope

This MCP manages **artifacts** through the resource server, nothing else. Folders, categories,
search/discovery, users, groups, and permissions are out of scope (ROADMAP.md). Artifact
*construction*, conversion, and client-side validation live in `cedar-artifact-mcp`; the two
compose (build there, persist here). If you're tempted to add file I/O or model-building logic
here, stop — it belongs elsewhere.
